# E-commerce Store Roadmap

Hey! This is my personal roadmap for building out my React + Printify + Stripe e-commerce store. I'll keep this updated as I go.

## Project Roadmap

- [x] Initialize React app from template
- [x] Set up project folder structure (api, components, pages, routes, store)
- [x] Install core dependencies (React, react-router-dom, zustand, axios, Stripe, Auth0, etc.)
- [x] Scaffold basic pages (Home, Product, Cart, Checkout, Orders)
- [x] Set up routing with react-router-dom
- [x] Add Zustand store for global state
- [x] Add placeholders for Printify and Stripe API utils
- [x] Add a navigation bar and basic layout (so the app feels like a real store!)
- [x] Integrate Printify API to fetch and display products
- [x] Build product listing and product detail pages
- [x] Implement cart functionality (add, remove, update items)
- [ ] Integrate Stripe Checkout for payments
- [ ] Set up user authentication (Auth0 or similar)
- [ ] Create orders dashboard for users to track shipments
- [ ] Add order history and order details pages
- [ ] Add error handling and loading states
- [ ] Polish up the UI and add responsive design
- [ ] Write tests for core features
- [ ] Prepare for Vercel deployment (env vars, build, etc.)
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel and test live
